# Air Crash Analysis
##Abstract
Aviation has become a common part of humansâ€™ lives since the first airplane was created. In
2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic started, more than 106,000 flights [1] and more than
12 million passengers [2] were operated daily. Airplanes are treated as the safest transport
type, but air crashes still happen, and in the worst cases, they can lead to hundreds of deaths.
In this paper, we will analyze the data about airplane crashes while providing some main
insights and tendencies, such as the average number of deaths per crash, the most dangerous
airlines, and the most popular causes of crashes.
